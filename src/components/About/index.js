      <p>
        My name is Steven Bendrick. I graduated from the University of Connecticut with a degeree in Chemical Engineering. 
        After graduating, I found a job doing database work in the Alumni and Development department at a local nonprofit boarding school. 
        I grew to enjoy doing database work and enjoyed learning more and more about how it all works. 
        After 5 years at the school, I noticed the database world was moving towards online applications. 
        I decided to enroll in the Uconn Coding Bootcamp to get into the world of online solutions. 
        I look forward to using my technical skills as a trained engineer and my first hand experience of helping end-users use online applications.
